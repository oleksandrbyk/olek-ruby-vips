TODO
* Verify that all memory gets released when vips ops return errors. Namely,
  make sure that the allocated IMAGEs get released via ruby's free callbacks.
* Allow for injecting ruby code into an image transformation pipeline (may be
  slow to call out to ruby with every read, but may be worthwhile for fun custom
  image processors).
* Tap into VIPS callback system to allow progress updates, etc.
* Allow for creating a ruby endpoint to the pipeline could be useful for
  streaming.
* Image#to_a
* look into other.h, audit all libvips methods and make sure they are all implemented
* JRuby support
* Don't entirely #ifdef out any ruby methods, even when not supported by the
  library version. Instead #ifdef in a ruby exception.
