# Notes

- revise docs ... we have a few undocumented still, they should probably be 
  private

- look over code and use eg. select in thing that searches for match_image

- what about enums like Vips::OperationRelational?

- check VipsInterpolation and affine with bicubic etc. 

- make Operation.new take a nick, not a pointer

- support complex constants, eg. 

	Complex(1, 2)
	=> (1+2i)

# Common operations

- version bump

  edit lib/vips/version.rb and VERSION

- reinstall local copy of gem after a change

  bundle exec rake install

- run test suite

  bundle exec rake 

- push new gem to rubygems, tag repository with version

  bundle exec rake release

- regenerate docs

  bundle exec rake yard
