# Notes

- leak audit, esp with blob handling and write_to_memory

- why don't we need to implement refstring?

- check over docs ... we have a few undocumented still, they should probably be 
  private

- support complex constants, eg. 

	Complex(1, 2)
	=> (1+2i)

# Common operations

- version bump

  edit lib/vips/version.rb and VERSION

- reinstall local copy of gem after a change

  bundle exec rake install

- run test suite

  bundle exec rake 

- push new gem to rubygems, tag repository with version

  bundle exec rake release

- regenerate docs

  bundle exec rake yard
