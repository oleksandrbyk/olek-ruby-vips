- lots of getpoint() on the result of stats() is clumsy

  how about to_a for images? only useful for small images, of course

- need something like ruby-vips occasional GC stuff, we can fill memory before
  a GC is triggered

  need a test case

- mail about the getpoint unimplemented error

- still missing a few enum docs

- add complex constants, eg. 

	Complex(1, 2)
	=> (1+2i)

- fix travis ... the difficulty is getting a libvips with goi built first,
  perhaps copy-paste from libvips .travis.yml

  this is almost enough to do the ruby side:

----------
env:
  global:
    - NOKOGIRI_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES=true

language: ruby
rvm:
  - 2.1
  - 2.2
  - 2.3

script: "bundle exec rake"

gemfile:
  - Gemfile

before_install:
  - uname -a
  - sudo apt-get update
  - sudo apt-get install libvips-dev
-----------
