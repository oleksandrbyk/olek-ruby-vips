# Notes

- speed up to_a, see the issue on this

  change should be in master as well

- check over docs ... we have a few undocumented still, they should probably be 
  private

- make inspect output prettier

irb(main):002:0> im = Vips::Image.black(100, 100)
=> #<Vips::Image:0x005607119ce000 @struct=#<Vips::Image::ManagedStruct:0x005607119cdf88>>

  bit crap

  same for gvalue?

- support complex constants, eg. 

	Complex(1, 2)
	=> (1+2i)

# Common operations

- version bump

  edit lib/vips/version.rb and VERSION

- reinstall local copy of gem after a change

  bundle exec rake install

- run test suite

  bundle exec rake 

- push new gem to rubygems, tag repository with version

  bundle exec rake release

- regenerate docs

  bundle exec rake yard
